# CZECH_BANK_ANALYSIS
In this project I worked on end-to-end financial data analysis project using the Czechoslovakia Bank dataset. This project is a fully functional automated financial model, where clients can simply upload data in AWS , and the dashboard will update automatically in Power BI.

3rd step [in Snowflake] :
