# CZECH_BANK_ANALYSIS
In this project I worked on end-to-end financial data analysis project using the Czechoslovakia Bank dataset. This is an interactive power bi dashboard, where datasets are uploaded in AWS, Database is created in Snowflake and the data is loaded in Power BI from Snowflake to perform Data Analysis.

This Project involved four major steps: 

**Excel > AWS > Snowflake > Power BI** 

**1st Step [in MS Excel ] :**
Basic Cleaning
Change File Type To CSV

**2nd Step [in AWS] :**

**3rd step [in Snowflake] :**
